##Code

###Spyder
[Spyderlib](http://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/) is an IDE for writing scientific python code. For fun, I gave it a new icon theme using "symbolic" icons that I find look much better, especially on mac. For your viewing pleasure, here is a source distribution of my modified Spyder:  [Archive file](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6613592/spyder-2.2.0dev.tar.gz)

You can run it via the command line from the source directory using "python bootstrap.py". You need its dependancies installed, see them at the [spyderlib wiki](http://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/wiki/Installation).
